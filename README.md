## Motivations
At the beginning, I wanted to secure my home. Basically, there have been a lot of burglaries around in 2019-2020.
On the market to day, we can find a lot of security cameras supposed to be intelligent and so on but I have a main concern: my privacy. I analyzed some security cameras, and I found some real bad things. So I decided to create everything myself. Sure a lot of open-source software exists, but... I don't want to be rude, but they are pretty bad designed, I could not understand easily the software to make my thing.

This project is build from the ground up for simplicity (for developers and users) and also privacy first.

## Status
This software is currently under development, and we are discovering some bug's day to day.


It is currently deployed in 3 homes with a total of 5 cameras to test it in the real world, gather some data, and improve the overall!
