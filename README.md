## Motivations
At the beginning, I wanted to secure my house. Basically, around my house there have been a lot of burglaries.
On the market to day, we can find a lot of security cameras, supposed to be intelligent and so one. But I have one concern: my privacy. I've analyzed some security camera and I found some real bad things. So I have decided to create everything myself. Sure a lot of open-source software exists, but... I don't want to be rude, but they are really bad designed.

This project is build from the ground up for simplicity, for developers and users, and also privacy first.
